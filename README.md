Modules used : Selenium, GhostJS and requests.

## Features

* Show Google Cache date for URLs in a file text (ex : from a Screaming Frog SEO Excel File).
* Get the date from text cached version, which is super fast.
* Support : the page exist (HTTP 200) but have no cache.
* Support : the page doesn't exist and return HTTP status.

Note : support only google.fr for the moment, most coming.

## How it works ?

1. Create an "urls.txt" file in the script current directory.
2. Set 1 URL per line.
3. Start the script.

Currently there is no GUI only console interface.

## What we get ?

Two arrays :
* 1 of the URLs scanned.
